\subsection{Object Lifetime}

The object lifecycle:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item allocation - memory is allocated by the OS as triggered by your code
  \item pre-initialization - overhead of making the memory a C++ object, naming it, connecting it to \underline{your} program!
  \item initialization - constructors are run
  \item use
  \item cleanup
  \item pre-deallocation
  \item deallocation
\end{enumerate}

There really are 3 types of objects in C++:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item automatic - allocated when the code requests that allocation and destroyed when out of scope
  \item static - allocated if code runs and they persist until the end of the program
  \item dynamic - allocated and destroyed dependent on how the program runs
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
class Trace {
  public:
    Trace(const char* name); //create and print message
    ~Trace();    

  private:
    enum {max = 100}; //max num objects to create
    static char existingObjs[max+1]; //L=Live, D=Dead
    static int totalCreated; //sequential number
    int instance;
    char varName[21];
};

int Trace::totalCreated = 0;
char Trace::existingObjs[1+max] = "";

Trace::Trace(const char* name) : instance(totalCreated++) {
  strncpy(varName, name, 20);
  varName[20] = '\0';
  if (totalCreated <= max) {
    existingObjs[totalCreated-1] = 'L'; //live now
    existingObjs[totalCreated] = '\0'; //live now
    cout << existingObjs << " trace created for " << varName << endl;
    totalCreated++;
  }
}

Trace::~Trace() {
  if (instance < max) {
    existingObjs[instance] = 'D';
    cout << existingObjs << " trace destroyed for " << varName << endl;
  } 
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Static variables}

Static variables can give state to a function. Static variables persist to the end of the program, destroying them in the reverse order in which they were allocated (on the heap). Also, local static variables are created first.
