\section{Introduction To Search}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open-loop problem solving steps are as follows\ldots
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Problem-formulation (actions \& states)
            \item Goal-formulation (states)
            \item Search (action sequences)
            \item Execute solution
        \end{enumerate}

        \item All well-defined problems have the following\ldots
            \begin{itemize}
                \item An initial state
                \item An actions set (usually denoted by $\textsc{Actions}(s)$)
                \item A transition model (usually denoted by $\textsc{Result}(s,\, a)$)
                \item A goal test
                \item A step cost (usually denoted by $\textsc{C}(s,\, a,\, s')$)
                \item Path cost
                \item Solution / optimal solution\footnote{The optimal solution is just the solution with the least path cost}
            \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
